1.0 Introduction to Role Playing Games
======================================

1.1 Introduction to Spirit and Sword
------------------------------------

'Spirit and Sword' is a fantasy roleplaying game (FRPG), being the third edition of a game called  'Swordbearer'. This was originally written in 1982 by Dennis Sustare as the main designer with Arnold Hendrick assisting, and published by Heritage Games. A second edition with minor changes was released in 1985 and published by Fantasy Games Unlimited.

Through these years 'Swordbearer' continued to have a dedicated, if small, following and generated a great deal of critical respect and reviews. This third edition is a thorough revision of the game which includes its core and original features whilst also simplifying the rules, elaboration on the material, and introducing new concepts more common with contemporary FRPGs.

Each introductory section to this game will include in some detail the changes between this and previous editions. For example this section now includes a thorough definition of roleplaying games, elaborating on the previous introduction. Whilst previous editions discussed some of the issues concerning metagaming, it is now explicitly stated, along with elaborations on player and GM responsibilities. This new edition includes an elaboration on game sessions and play which includes a discussion of many of the technologies that were simply not available or uncommon when earlier editions of the book were produced.

One feature that is certainly being kept is size; many contemporary roleplaying games have fallen into a trap of assuming that word count equates with detail, producing multi-hundred page tomes over several books. This really is unnecessary; a good core system which is evocative, imaginative, and that is applied with consistency, can provide a superior game with less words. Swordbearer certainly provided a great deal of content with a relatively short page count when it was released and it this new edition will certainly attempt the same.

1.2 What Is A Fantasy Adventure Role-Playing Game?
--------------------------------------------------

The four terms in the name indicate what sort of product 'Spirit and Sword' represents. In many ways a roleplaying game is like improvised and participatory script-writing or radio theatre. There are many different role-playing games (RPGs) available; but since their inception in the mid-1970s those with a fantasy settings have always been the most popular.

By 'fantasy' what is meant is the literary tradition which incorporates supernatural elements as tropes into an earthly setting, typically premodern. 'Spirit and Sword' has a late medieval setting, with technologies such as plate armour but elaborated to include wizards, ghosts, giants, dwarves, elves, unicorns, dragons, magical artifacts, and the like.

By ‘adventure’ what is meant is the dramatic situation and narrative that follows. This is not a game of the mundane experiences of quiet lives, but rather one where the characters aspire to greatness or have it forced upon them. The actions and consequences have grave importance to the setting and whether they succeed or fail, theirs is a story worth recording.

The third phrase, 'role playing', indicates a player's activity in the game. A player takes up a role, being a character in such a setting. The personality of this character can be very different to the person who is playing the character, and indeed this can be a test of a player's creativity, imagination, acting, and ability to see a world through another's eyes. Typically one player in a session of a game, the Gamemaster, takes up all the roles of characters not allocated to other players.

The final phrase, 'game', suggests a structured set of rules. With the rules the players can generate characters with a system which provides, to a degree, a codified simulation of the setting. One player, the Gamemaster (GM), adjudicates these rules and determines their application to the particular situation that the characters find themselves in.

1.3 Players, Characters, and Metagaming
---------------------------------------

An important distinction in RPGs is the difference between the players and the characters. The player is the flesh-and-blood person who attends the game session. A player may have one or more characters, although a player with multiple characters is typically recommended for those who have had sufficient experience in playing different roles. Characters which are run by players are known as player-characters (PCs, a common term for such games) or, to use the original proposed name for Swordbearer, their Avatar.

A player should familiarise themselves with at least the relevant rules that relate to their character. This includes the process involved for character generation and task resolution. If they are likely to be using magic, then the magical abilities that they have and their options, and if a warrior, then the combat rules. The GM on the other hand has a tougher job - they must be familiar with all the rules of the game!

Whilst a player may develop some attachment to their character (rather like how one can develop an attachment to a protagonist in a novel or film) it is also worthwhile valuing the character not just for overcoming adversaries, but also their contribution to the story when they do not succeed, even to the point where the character suffers mortal injury as a result.

One very important way of showing this realistic narrative value is for players to describe their characters actions with a pretense of metagame ignorance. Metagaming is any behaviour where the player describes actions based on the players knowledge rather than what the character would know, and should be avoided. A Gamemaster should intervene with a gentle reminder in such cases, "your character wouldn't do that!". Indeed, good roleplaying humour can be derived with a player directs their Avatar into disaster with such a veil of ignorance, rather like situational comedies that take advantage of the viewer’s privileged position.

This also applies for GMs as well. The Gamemaster must act out the behaviour of all the characters in the game's setting with the exception of those controlled by the players, i.e., non-player characters (NPCs). Whilst some NPCs will be direct antagonists to the PCs, this must not become a competition between the Gamemaster and the players, as that will become one-sided very quickly. An objective of the GM is to set challenging situations for the players to respond to with their characters, not to grind their avatars into dust.

The GM sets the scene, establishes the narrative flow (both within each session and between sessions), plays out the role of the NPCs, and describes the perceptual detail that the PCs experience to their players. In a sense, they combine the roles of narrator, director, and sometimes actor along with their role of rules referee.

In some circumstances it may even be possible to split these roles if there is a particularly large group of players (say a dozen or more). One GM could take up the role of Narrator, describing the scenes that the PCs find themselves in, whereas another could act as Judge as the rules referee, whereas even a third could manage the details of larger scale task resolution (e.g., a large melee conflict).

Experienced players may rotate the role of Gamemaster between different game sessions, with all involved contributing in a larger scale to the setting and story. It also gives the person who is usually GM to have a break from the often consuming task of designing a world and building a story!

1.4 Game Sessions
-----------------

A game session is usually and traditionally conducted with four to six players meeting face-to-face for a period of about three to four hours. In some occasions these meetings can be electronically mediated for geographically dispersed players, such as the use of an instant messaging system, or through an asynchronous media such as email or a webforum. As a social gathering the usual considerations of friendly behaviour must apply.

Each player will be provided sheets for their Avatars ("character sheets") which include all the pertinent information of that character. The GM has to have notes about the environment, the various beings that are located there, their relationships with each other, and at least summary information of these characters.

In a game session the GM provides the opening situation to the PCs. This is often in the form of a quest-like adventure (e.g., the local lord sends a commission for the PCs to rescue the princess or slay the dragon, a wizard arrives at the door looking for someone to carry magic ring, etc). How the PCs react to the challenge is entirely up to them, and the GM must respond appropriately, introducing new scenes with accompanying situations and conflicts as the story develops. An adventure may take one or more sessions to complete, and several adventures can develop in a larger campaign of related events. A literary analogy is to compare scenes, chapters, and stories.

Unusual for most games, much of a RPG session does not require the use of a board. It is more of a conversation between the players and the GM of their situation and the character actions, with references to their characters abilities, and the use of dice to generate the results of indeterminate situations. On occasions however the use of a board with miniature figures may assist in illustrating complex tactical situations.

2.0 Introduction to Spirit and Sword
=========================

'Spirit and Sword' has a number of unique features not commonly found in other RPGs. The following summary provides an overview to the conventions, rules, and what is different here compared to earlier editions of 'Swordbearer'.

2.1 Time and Distance
-----------------------------

A distinction between real-time and game-time is required in all RPGs, and 'Spirit and Sword' is no exception. An adventure could take several sessions of real-time to play out spanning weeks, yet the game-time could be as little as a few hours. The time that passes between adventures depends heavily on the sort of campaign and story that the GM is running. It is not unusual, in generating a saga-like story for example, to have a year of game-time between adventures. Adventures, after all, should represent a special and dramatic part of a character's life, a punctuated equilibrium.

'Spirit and Sword' also has a standardised units of measurement used by GMs and players describing the environment and character actions. Whilst the various cultures in a GMs world-setting would have their own units of measurement, just like our own world, a standard system makes game-play easier. However, our own standard metric system, whilst popular for science fiction RPGs, would be out of place in a fantasy RPG.

Unless the GM has made significant different decisions concerning the length of the year, the number of moons, and so forth, 'Spirit and Sword' makes use of the more evocative historical units of measurements simplified for game play. They are also deliberately approximate, an appropriate simulation of the imprecision of the time.

For distances, the base unit is the "pace", which is roughly around a yard or a metre. As a longer unit the "league" is used, being about 3 miles or 5 kilometres, and about the distance that they average person would walk in an hour. Whilst hours are used, the main period of time in the medieval world was rougher, based around 6-hour punctuations and used for prayers; Matins for the dawn (circa 6am), Noon (midday), Vespers for sunset (circa 6pm), and Compline (circa midnight). Whilst this is obviously most appropriate for late medieval games with a European flavour, the principle of six-hour punctuations works well in a variety of settings.


2.2 Dice Notation and Rounding
-----------------------------------------

Multi-sided dice are used to simulate the effects of dramatic and indeterminate situations. The notation used is conventional for various RPGs. With the representation of xdy, the 'x' represents the number of dice, and the 'dy' represents the number of sides. 'Spirit and Sword' uses d6 and d10 (six-sided and ten-sided dice) with a d100 (range of 1 to 100) represented by rolling two ten-sided dice with one representing the tens and the other dice the ones. A result of "00" indicated "100".

Arithmetic operations can be elaborated to this notation e.g., 2d6+2 (roll 2 six-sided dice, add two the sum, giving a range of 4-14, with an average of 9). The PEDMAS standard order of operations applies (parentheses, exponents, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction) if there is any doubt.

Unless otherwise indicated, round real numbers (fractions) to the nearest integer (whole number). Exact halves (.5) are rounded down.

2.3 Characters
-------------------

'Spirit and Sword' uses a standardised system for creating all characters regardless of kindred. Note that the game does not use the term 'race' (as it is scientifically inaccurate and a politically-laden term) nor 'species' (as it is too modern) to represent a collective noun for the different sapient beings.

The prime characteristics are kept to a minimum; Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Status, and Experience, with the latter initially derived from Age. A character's Age may also mean changes in other characteristics. In addition to these prime characteristics there are temperamental characteristics based on the character's Humours, and fatalistic conditions based on their zodiac sign.

Unlike many other RPGs, 'Spirit and Sword' uses Status to represent purchasing power and property rights for the characters rather than keeping track of mundane equipment and coinage. This feature was original to 'Swordbearer' and since been copied to other game systems. Characters are expected to act according to their status or risk the effects of not living up to expectations or worse still for engaging in presumptuous (c.f., 'sumptuary laws') impersonations.

2.4 Spheres and Skills
----------------------

Many RPGs either have an entirely open-ended approach to character ability acquisition which ignores the pervasive influence of background and profession, or they have restrictive and contrived character classes. In contrast 'Spirit and Sword' uses environment and occupational "spheres" which represent central influences in the character's background. All beginning characters must choose one environmental and one occupational sphere, representing their childhood background and their adolescent apprenticeship. A character may change their occupational sphere as readily as they change occupations and a new environmental sphere as they change their environment. At all time however, they will have one, and only one, of each.

The environmental spheres are Mountains, Hills, Plains, Desert, Sylvan, Riverine, Oceanic, Urban, and Otherworld. The occupational spheres are Noble, Warrior, Priest, Rogue, Mage, Performer, Merchant, Domestic, Healer, Artisan, Farmer, Ranger. Each sphere comes with a number of skills which are related to that sphere; a skill may belong to multiple spheres. A character who specialises in a sphere will find learning those sphere skills to be at lot easier than those outside the sphere. A character whose occupation is "Warrior" will find learning weapon-related skills somewhat easier than one who is a "Domestic" - however no character is forbidden by the rules of learning a particular skill.

2.5 Task Resolution
-------------------

Skills in 'Spirit and Sword' are represented as a percentage rating, indicating the mastery of an character at a particular task, usually as a combination of their characteristic and training. Most tasks are carried out with skills, whose rating is a combination of both the prime characteristics (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Status) and specific learning. However in some cases the task being attempted is more of the raw, untrained, characteristic. In such cases, multiply the characteristic by five to determine an equivalent percentile rating.

Where there is dramatic indeterminism, percentile dice (d100) are rolled to determine whether the character succeeded or failed at the task. There are four possible results from such a roll; a success, where the dice-roll is equal to or less than the skill rating, a failure where it is greater than the rating, a critical where it is 10% of the rating, or a fumble, where it is 10% of the failure range.

Task resolution in contested and tactical time requires determining the character's initiative based on weapon length and skill, with declaration of actions occurring from instant to instant. An attempted blow may be parried or dodged by a defender, which apart from providing protection can also improve their tactical position. If a blow does land, then hit location is determined, along with damage based on the character's Strength and the weapon being used. Armour may also reduce the effects of this damage. For speed of play, it is recommended that a player who is attacking rolls the "to hit", "damage" and "location" dice simultaneously.

Apart from directed violence, adventuring characters have a tendency to suffer from a variety of sources, which are reflected in the as abstract 'Wound Points'. They may find themselves drowning, falling, poisoned, diseased, with all manner of harms occurring, all of which are described in the game rules. Those who are heroic will have great stories told about them, but many are the graves of the unlucky.

2.6 Magic
---------

'Spirit and Sword' offer three evocative magic types which differ in terms of the game-world origin and cover different types of magic, but generally have similar mechanics and are treated just the same as any other task resolution. The three magic types are Elemental, Spiritual, and Celestial magics and are actually derived from traditional notions of supernatural power, being the Chinese elements, the Hellenic humours, and the Sumero-Babylonian astrological signs. In most game-worlds the use of magic will be subject to political and religious regulation.

The first type represents the harnessing of the pure essence of of a physical elemental force. The second type allows characters access to the motivating spirit and personality common to sapient creatures, animals, and even sometimes plants or inanimate objects! The third type allows for predictions and fatalistic geases to be employed.

2.7 Worlds
----------

The 'Spirit and Sword' game system is best designed for a late medieval setting, based on the technologies available and the example Status levels evident in both this and earlier editions of the game. This suggests a few things, including the domination of a feudal political system, the development of steel, a community of scholars, trade networks, and - perhaps controversially - competing monotheistic religious bodies. This is not to suggest that iron age technologies, village-based societies, or polytheistic pagans will not be found or cannot be the centre of a GMs world, let alone stone-age animists. Just like in our own world such cultures existed well into the late medieval period and beyond! It is just the game system is set in a period where these powers are not dominant.

'Spirit and Sword' provides a sample gameworld [EDIT] and adventures, so a players can begin right away with the system. The world is deliberately open-ended and GMs are encouraged to elaborate the setting further or develop their own fantasy worlds. Extensive information is provided in the Gamemaster's Guide with regard to geography, environment, and cultures for the creation of such worlds.

2.8 Third Edition Changes
-------------------------

The second edition of Swordbearer, published three years after the original, contained only minor changes. The third edition in contrast has undergone a thorough review of every single rule with many changes, even if the core system, ideas, and especially unique features, remain intact. Translation from an early edition game to this new edition requires very little work.

Most notably, the previous edition separate but linked characteristics of Mass and Strength have been combined, with kindred notes if there is a significant difference in body density. A point-buy method has been introduced for characteristics, with a simplification of the experience point system. Starting Spirit nodes for characters are now explicit to represent character temperament. The old occupation and spheres have been replaced by environmental and occupational spheres. The 'things' system for property has been changed and a simple encumbrance system introduced.

There has been elaborations to the magic system with changes to the elements and an extension to both the number of Elemental and Spiritual spells. A new magic system, Celestial magic, has been introduced. There have been simplifications in the casting procedure and greater flexibility introduced to the spells. The bestiary has also been extended somewhat and integrated with elaborations and simplifications to the world design guide. A new default setting has been introduced along with starting scenarios to get players on their way.

3.0 Character Creation
=================

Beginning characters, or Avatars, must determine their Avatar name, sex, homeland, and their environmental and occupational spheres. After that their Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Age, and Status are determined. These characteristics are determined either by a 2d10 roll for each random component of the value or with a point-buy method, where 55 points can be distributed as the player wants for their character. The GM will advise the player which method is available, and may even offer both.

The point-buy method does ensure that all the Avatars in the group are "equal but different", whereas the random method may have an additional degree of realism, but suffers from the possibility of the generation of "oafs" or "superheroes". Such characters can be a challenge to roleplay and may offend a sense of fairness.

3.1 Name, Sex, and Spheres
--------------------------------------

In generating an Avatar, the first decisions must be who they are, their homeland, and what their background is. This the Avatar's Name, Sex, Homeland, Environment Sphere, and Occupation Sphere. In most cases the Environment Sphere will equate with where the character grew up, and the Occupation Sphere their parent's profession. Depending on the character's Age (see below) that may have additional Environment and Occupational spheres that add to the Avatar's life-path and can be noted on their character sheet. At the very minimum, a character will begin with one Environmental Sphere (based on their childhood home) and one Occupational Sphere (based on one of their parent's Spheres).

In generating these attributes consultation with the GM is highly recommended, especially for beginning characters. The GM will almost certainly have a regional map of the gameworld which will include the geography and cultures. This will establish the range of options that the Avatar will have for their Environmental Sphere, but will also provide some suggestions of the Avatar's name. Often GMs will have a gameworld which has rough equivalents to real-world cultures, and it is a good idea to avoid anachronisms in a character's name and behaviour (e.g., the player should avoid choosing an Anglo-Saxon name when the Avatar comes from a culture analogous to feudal Japan).

The Environmental Spheres that a player may choose for their beginning Avatar are Mountains, Hills, Plains, Desert, Sylvan, Riverine, Urban. The Oceanic Environment Sphere is for those who spend the majority of their life on seaborne vessels and whilst technically available for beginning Avatars, should be extremely rare. The Otherworld Environment Sphere represents the parallel and hidden worlds inhabited by fey creatures and is not recommended for beginning Avatars.

The Occupational Spheres are Noble, Warrior, Priest, Rogue, Mage, Performer, Merchant, Domestic, Healer, Artisan, Farmer, and Ranger, all of which are described in greater detail in section 4.2 Spheres and Skill Association. They are deliberately broadly designed so that the occupations may be applied in across different cultures and technologies. For example, the Ranger occupation applies to any form of wide-ranging wilderness traveller. It could equally apply to an protector of the marches, a primitive hunter, a military scout, a courier, or a variety of other specific implementations.

3.2 Strength
------------

A human Avatar's Strength is rated from 2-20. A character's Strength determines how much they can lift and carry (based on abstract Encumbrance points), how many Wound points they can take, what the character's size is, in weight and volume. Strength is also used (with Agility) to calculate the character's running movement in paces per instant (Strength plus Agility = Paces per Instant).

3.3 Agility
------------

A human Avatar's Agility is rated from 2-20. Agility is used as the foundation of a great number of character skills and, along with Strength, determines the character’s running movement rate.

3.4 Intelligence
-------------------

A human Avatar's Intelligence is rated from 2-20. Intelligence is used as the foundation for a number of skills and determines the number of experience points that the character receives on an annual basis through their Spheres.

3.5 Age and Experience
-------------------------------

A human Avatar's Age is rated from 2-20 with 14 added, meaning that beginning Avatars will start from 16 to 34 years of age. Age determines experience. A character receives four times their Intelligence in experience points as a base (representing childhood and early adolescence), plus their Intelligence in experience points for every year after 16.

Thus Avatars can start with quite a range of background experience! An especially dull 16-year old will have only 4 experience points, and one must wonder why such an individual is going adventuring. Likewise an exceptionally intelligent and older individual (Intelligence 20, Age 34) will start with a hefty 400 experience points, and one may also wonder the importance of such a quest that requires one of such towering intellect. The more likely average, with Intelligence 11 and Age 25, will have 143 experience points (44 from their background, 99 from 11 years experience).

3.6 Status
---------

A human Avatar's Status is rated from 2-20; this distribution assumes a range of the most limited level of political freedom (Status 2) to a count or bishop level (Status 20). An average character (Status 11) would represent well-to-do merchant, retainer to nobility, junior officer, or clerical brother. This range in no way reflects the distribution of the population in a medieval society, which would have approximately 90% of the population ranging from Status 0 to 10!

A GM may wish to modify the starting Status for characters who come from different cultural and technological backgrounds. Technological development allows for a wider range of labour differentiation. Whilst an increased division of labour does not necessarily mean greater societal differentiation, it does allow for its potential. Stone-aged animist cultures should be limited to Status 15, whereas Iron-age polytheistic cultures should be limited should be limited to Status 20.

3.7 Characteristic Variations
------------------------------------

The characteristics generated for a character assume a base starting human age of between 16 and 30. Characters younger and older than these ages will have variations based on their age, whether by development (younger, towards 16) or decline (older, after 30). For every two year between 0 to 10, Agility, Strength, and Intelligence increase by an additional 5% of this base score (i.e., 10% at 2, 20% at 4, 30% at 6, 40% at 8, 50% at 10). For every year from 11 to 15, the three characteristics increase by an additional 10% per year. A reminder is given that raw cognitive ability (Intelligence) in no way reflects experience, knowledge, or willpower.

Agility declines at a rate of 10% per five years starting at age 30, Strength declines 10% per five years starting at 45, and Intelligence declines 10% per five years starting at 60. A character with a zero rating in Agility is Crippled and unable to move unaided. A character with a zero rating in Strength suffer Fragility; any wound or illness will kill unless treated with immediacy. A character with a zero rating in Intelligence suffers Senility; they are incapable of engaging in prolonged rational or reflective thought, although they may carry out mental processes from habit.

Some players prefer to be attentive to sexual dimorphism in character design. Whilst there is no rule to enforce this, some general guidelines can be considered. In terms of pure musculature, the average human female is approximately 2/3rds of the strength (size and musculature) of the male. However, a longer lifespan and resistance to disease equates with greater wound points minimises this difference in that characteristic to an average of only 10% difference to that the male. In a commensurate difference, appears that the average male agility (bodily flexibility, manual dexterity) is roughly equivalent in relative value.

3.8 Spirit and Signs
--------------------

An Avatar begins play with two Spirit nodes, one which was acquired with birth and made itself apparent during childhood, and one which was latent and made itself apparent at the beginning of their adolescence. With experience and time, they may even gain further spirit nodes. A person of "great personality" may even several! There are circumstances where a character loses their Spirit nodes; a character with no spirit may still be conscious, apparently intelligent, but they would have lost their inner spark and drive.

The Spirit within a character represent their temperament and force of personality, both in a positive and negative sense. The Spirit nodes available derive from the ancient Hellenic humours; sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or phlegmatic. There is an equal distributed chance (25%) of a beginning Avatar one of these Spirit nodes and they may have two of the same type, in which case that temperament will be very pronounced.

A character's birth-spirit also determines the season that they were born in, and thus their zodiac sign. Spirit and Sword uses a zodiac system derived from the Sumero-Babylonian system, of which the basic signs are familiar to most players. The details are abstracted, but have a game effect through the Celestial magics.

The Spirits, their temperaments, and related Zodiac signs are as follows:

Sanguine Humour. Temperament: courageous, hopeful, playful, carefree. Vernal signs: The Corn, The Scales The Scorpion

Choleric Humour. Temperament: ambitious, argumentative, restless, angry. Summer signs: The Soldier, The Goat-Fish, The Pitcher, The Fish-Cord

Melancholic Humour. Temperament: depressed, quiet, analytical, serious. Autumn signs: Pisces, The Farmer, The Bull

Phlegmatic Humour., Temperament: calm, thoughtful, patient, peaceful. Winter signs: The Twins, The Crayfish, The Lion

4.0 Experience, Skills, and Spheres
===================================

4.1 Initial Spheres and Experience
----------------------------------

To reiterate, a human Avatar's receives four times their Intelligence in experience points as a base (representing childhood and early adolescence), plus their Intelligence in experience points for every year after 16. Starting Avatars also must at least one Environment Sphere and Occupation Sphere, representing their life before becoming an adventurer. It is recommended that beginning players simply select one of each. More experienced players may wish to include the changes in generating a pre-adventuring life-path. The decision to become an adventurer is not one that is taken lightly. It represents a major upheaval in the character's life and often a break from the family Environment and Occupation.

It is very possible in the course of the events that follow that they will pick up new Environments and Occupations in the generation of the story of their life, assuming that they can satisfy any prerequisites. Note that the requirements of an Occupational Sphere does not necessarily apply for the childhood and adolescent period. For example a character may have an pre-adventuring Occupational Sphere as a Noble, but due to a change in political circumstances, their starting Status is a far less than what would be expected!

4.2 Spheres and Skill Association
---------------------------------

Each Sphere, Occupational and Environmental, has five favoured skills and even characteristics (for training). These favoured skills provide the character skill ratings at a rate discounted from those which are not favoured. The Environmental Spheres (Mountains, Hills, Plains, Desert, Sylvan, Riverine, Urban, Oceanic, Otherworld) are provided ecological and social descriptions, along with their favoured skills. The Occupational Sphere (Noble, Warrior, Priest, Rogue, Mage, Performer, Merchant, Domestic, Healer, Artisan, Farmer, Ranger) are provided with the range of descriptive implementations along with their favoured skills.

Mountains: A mountain environment is defined as a landform that rises relatively abruptly from the surrounding regions and and is at least 500 paces above sea level. The steepness and height results in significantly cooler climates than the surrounds, and are notable for their alpine and montane ecology and isolated microclimates. The lack of level land and poor soil quality results in low human population density. Other kindred, especially dwarves, are more at home in the environment carving entire towns from the mountainside, with both the capacity and the volition to engage in a diet of not only sheep, goats, but also a variety of mushrooms, moss, lichen, and tussock.

Characters with the Mountain Environmental Sphere receive the following skills at a favoured rate: Element (Air), Climb, Miner, Region Knowledge, Survival 

Hills: A hills environment is defined as a landform that rises relatively smoothly from the surrounding regions and is 500 paces or less above sea level. The height tends to generate slighter warmer or cooler temperatures depending on the seasons. Hills, unlike mountains, are generally covered with soil and vegetation. Due to water flow hills are often used to direct irrigation and thus have a higher population density. The hills environment, if the rainfall is suitable, is favoured for sheep, goat, and cattle herds and, if properly landscaped can be used for rice farming.

Characters with the Hills Environmental Sphere receive the following skills at a favoured rate: Agronomy, Athletics, Herding, Region Knowledge, Ride

Plains: Plain are geographically flat areas, existing both as as lowlands at the bottom of valleys and on plateaus. They are typically originally formed from flowing lava, water, ice, wind, or by erosion from these agents from hills and mountains. They are very popular areas for farming, not just because the lay of the land is suitable for agriculture and grazing, but also because the soil quality is often very good, due to the deposits of sediments.

Characters with the Plains Environmental Sphere receive the following skills at a favoured rate: Element: Earth, Agronomy, Herding, Perception, Region Knowledge

Desert: Desert: Regardless of geographical form or even temperature, a desert is defined primarily by ecological and climatic considerations; it is an area of little precipitation which is especially harsh for animal or plant life. The lack of plant life further reduces the potential hospitality of such locales, as the unprotected surface becomes eroded and if rain does occur, they are often subject to flash flooding. The lack of soil strength and plant life also means such environments can be subject to dust storms, except in those which have been worn down to hard rock. Whilst there is almost always some inevitable and stubborn life, human population density is very low, clustered around the occasional source of water (e.g., underground water springs) or from nomadic trade routes.

Characters with the Desert Environmental Sphere receive the following skills at a favoured rate: Astrology: (any one), Element: Fire, Region Knowledge, Survival, Willpower

Sylvan: Sylvan: Also independent of the geographical form, a sylvan environment is one notable of density of tree biomass resulting in canopy cover of more than 50%, which distinguishes it from woodland. Forest environments can vary from the subarctic taiga of evergreen conifers, temperate broadleaf deciduous, temperate conifers, tropical and subtropical rainforests and so forth. Whilst forest have a low human population density, except on the edges for logging purposes, they are famed as a homeland for elvenfolk and as a location to their otherworldly realms. They also have a high population of animal life.

Characters with the Sylvan Environmental Sphere receive the following skills at a favoured rate: Element: Wood, Region Knowledge, Survival, Track, Woodwork

Riverine: A riverine environment in this context refers to an area of land near a water region, be it swamp, river, lake, sea, or ocean. The specific geological form will, of course, depend highly on the type of nearby water but there are common features, especially on the cultural level as all riverine cultures will be highly dependent on the water for resources. One of the notable reasons of the success of human kindred has been their ability to successfully colonise major waterways.

Weapon: Axe (Physical). This is the skill governing the use of a variety of axe-class weapons, including the hand-axe, battle-axe, and halberd. These weapons are one- or two-handed, are unbalanced with a cutting edge. Their impressive impact and cleaving damage is caused by the leveraging effect and concentrated edge. Axe-class weapons can be surprisingly efficient as a parrying weapon as the skilled user uses the haft to block and deflect incoming blows, although this is only effective if the user has recovered from an attack (next instant) or is yet to attack. Axe-class weapons tend to have a poor weapon speed due to the style of their use, but they often do have a better length of attack.

Weapon: Bow (Physical). This is the skill governing the use of a variety of bow-class weapons, including the self-bow, the recurve-bow, and the long-bow. These weapons are all two-handed, firing arrow projectiles with a variety of effects, primarily bodkins and broadheads, used respectively on armoured and unarmoured opponents. Their puncturing capacity is based on the bow’s design and the user’s pull (Strength). Bow-class weapons can achieve impressive ranges through  arced firing and can be surprisingly as a parrying weapon to block and deflect incoming blows, although this is almost invariably damages the weapon and is only used in dire straits. Bow-class weapons tend to have an excellent weapon speed.

4.4 Characteristic Improvement
------------------------------


4.5 Skill Improvement
---------------------

In most cases characters above the age of 16 will receive their Intelligence in experience points to spend on skill improvement, with the most efficient distribution being for those skills which are part of their Environmental or Occupational Sphere. Characters who are adventurers will also receive a skill check if they roll a critical failure or a critical success during an adventure. If this occurs they can immediately test if they have learned from the experience. The reasoning for this is well-established; in testing, uncertain, and dangerous situations moments of great success and great failure are highly memorable.

The procedure for adventure improvement is as follows; the player rolls against the character's current skill rating. If they succeed, they do not learn anything new, as this sort of knowledge is something they have already acquired. If they fail however, they have gained some new knowledge or insight which is memorable and gain an immediate +1% to their skill. A character can receive multiple experience checks, even on the same skill, during an adventure. Characteristic tests are not subject to adventure-based gains.

Based on skill or ability level - no roll. Simply refer to value.

Difficulty bonuses or penalties represent variation of skill level from 50%. e.g., Churgiary skill of 30% is used for First Aid; in a tactical situation, a first aid skill bonus is +20%. Likewise a churgiary skill of 70% is used for resetting broken bones would mean -20% to skill.

Hurried and uncertain activities. Roll. Failure typically means "falling just short", "success" means equal to skil, critical success/failure.

Merchant: The Merchant occupation is for those who trade in commodities produced by others. Their income is their ability to be a "middle man" between producers of goods and consumers, making their fortune through both economies of scale, and shrewdly when a producer sells cheaply and a consumer is prepared to pay the highest price. Sometimes this is achieved over time, with the merchant taking up the role of a collector with the assumption that a good's future value will increase. Merchants can range in power from rag-and-bone scavengers, retailers, and wholesalers who supply retail merchants. The Status of merchants is thus quite variable, but with maximum levels depending on the culture in question - some consider being "in trade" to be extremely dishonourable, lower that directly productive workers. Merchants often band together into companies in order to extract monopolistic profits.

Characters with the Merchant Occupational Sphere received the following skills at a favoured rate:  [EDIT]

Healer: The Healer occupation consists of those who apply folk medicines, herbalism, humourism, acupuncture, massage, surgical operations, and prostheses. It is a wide-ranging occupation which can range from surgeons (who also perform haircuts), midwives, dieticians, herablists, to therapists of the spirit. As various types of trauma, illnesses, diseases, and "imbalances of the humours" are common in the premodern world, healers who have a real or imagined reputation for competence are in great demand. Healers may share knowledge as a semi-formal association and take up a common oath of practise (e.g., Hippocratic Oath). Healers are rarely members of a ruling culture and a limited to a Status of 17.

Characters with the Healer Occupational Sphere received the following skills at a favoured rate:  [EDIT]

Artisan: The Artisan occupation consists of various craft workers who combine functionality with aesthetic insight to provide items of great quality. In the pre-industrial world, the handicraft of the artisans is the basis for consumer products; they are responsible for furniture, clothing, jewellery, all manner of household items, implements, and tools. According to Status and experience, those of the Artisan occupation who own their business are referred to as "masters" who may have a number of "journeymen" or "apprentices" learning the trade. Artisan masters often combine into guilds in order to guard professional secrets and to encourage monopolistic profits.

Farmer

A farmer[1] (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).

Farming has been dated back as far as the Neolithic era. By the Bronze Age, the Sumerians had an agriculture specialized labour force by 5000–4000 BCE, and heavily depended on irrigation to grow crops. They relied on three-person teams when harvesting in the spring.[2] The Ancient Egypt farmers farmed and relied and irrigated their water from the Nile.[3]

Animal husbandry, the practice of rearing animals specifically for farming purposes, has existed for thousands of years. Dogs were domesticated in East Asia about 15,000 years ago. Goats and sheep were domesticated around 8000 BCE in Asia. Swine or pigs were domesticated by 7000 BCE in the Middle East and China. The earliest evidence of horse domestication dates to around 4000 BCE.[4]

Ranger

Rangers were officials employed to "range" through the countryside providing law and order (often against poaching). Their duties were originally confined to seeing that the Forest Law was enforced in the outlands, or purlieus, of the royal forests. Their duties corresponded in some respects with that of a mounted Forester.[1]

A forester was also a title used widely during Medieval times. The forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer, and he could act as a barrister or arbiter. He was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble's property, hence the synonymous term 'woodward'. His duties included negotiating deals for the sale of lumber and timber and stopping poachers from illegally hunting. Many times wanted criminals would hide in a forest, when this occurred it was the duty of the Forester to organize armed gangs to capture the criminal. Their pay was usually above average and they could make a decent living.[1]

The term ranger seems to correspond to the Medieval Latin word regardatores which appeared in 1217 in the Charter of the Forest. Regardatores was later rendered as rangers in the English translations of the Charter.[2] However, others translate regardatores as regarders. For example, the fifth clause of the Charter of the Forest is commonly translated thus: "Our regarders shall go through the forests making the regard as it used to be made at the time of the first coronation of the aforesaid King Henry [II] our grandfather, and not otherwise."[3] A "regard" is considered to be an inspection of the forest.

The earliest letter patent found mentioning the term refer to a commission of a ranger in 1341.[4] Documents from 1455 state that England had “all manner and singular Offices of Foresters and Rangers of our said Forests”.[5]

One of the first appearances of ranger in literature is in Edmund Spenser's poem The Shepheardes Calendar from 1579: "[Wolves] walk not widely, as they were wont, for fear of rangers and the great hunt."

The office of Ranger of Windsor Great Park appears to have been created in 1601.

Intro
-----

What is FRPGs, clearly state unfolding of a story, playing a character
(use Swordbearer term 'Avatar' for PCs), simulation aspect, game
aspect. Swordbearer is effectively set in the late medieval period (c1400s
in terms of earth technology).

Non-human kindred? How rare and alien? Bunrabs and Moonspiders? Elves, 
Dwarves, and Halflings?

Unique aspects of SB: social status (no money tracking), evocative
magic system, gritty realism in combay. Expanded new version has
magic system affecting character personality in a direct manner and
fatalism.


CharGen

Characteristics: Keep close to original game, as massive changes mean that
it is not part of the same game history.

- Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Status : 
Roll 2d10 or point buy: 44 points

- Age and Experience
Roll 2d10 or point buy?
Influence of Int on skills?

- Spirit
3 spirit nodes. Choose or roll.

- Environment Sphere: Town, Country, Wilderness
- Occupation Sphere: Crafter, Healer, Merchant, Warrior etc.

Skills
------

- Change XP to match percentages.
- Roll under percentage based. 1XP per skill point, 2 per skill point 
if Sphere, double cost if over 50%, triple if over 75%. Doublecost if a social skill, triple if a physical skill (physical skills
are learned *slowly*, natural ability tends to be more important).

Check RuneQuest 6th edition and D&D 3.5 for resolution effects and
difficulty numbers. 

Use char-based starting percentages; physical skills are usually
STR+AGI, mental skills are usually INT, social skills are usually
SOC*2

Some weapons or equipment can further improved the percentage
ability!

Criticals and fumbles occur 10% of the time. Use actual percentages
or '0' on dice?

No need for modifications on the roll!

Or maybe my Call of Cthulhu and RQ3e hacks?

Task Resolution and Combat
--------------------------

Everything is contested, whether with a static target number or
an active one.

Use a lot of GURPS-based 'reality checking' for target numbers
and other modications. Plenty of examples don't hurt!

Reach and Speed
- 5 second combat "instants"
- missile weapons first, then long reach, medium reach, and short 
reach, finally spells.
- within each category (M, LR, MR, SR, Sp) act according to Speed, 
which is skills + weapon/spell modifier

To Hit
- Roll under to hit.
- Roll for location
- Apply damage (static with success levels, or rolled?), and check
for breakage. Strength base plus weapon bonus.
- Reduce from armour
- Apply results.

Roll attack, damage, hit location with one roll!

Parry and dodge rules? Acrobatics as a skill for dodging, not as
easy but provides complete protection 1 per round. Parry provides
an armour bonus, may not be enough.

Magic
-----

3 types of magic; elemental, spiritual, celestial.
- Elemental magic based around capturing pure examples of the
elemental essence. Use Chinese elements.
- Spiritual magic based around the temperamental elements
embodied in sapient beings. Use Hellenic humours.
- Celestial magic based around prediction and fates. Use
Bablyonian zodiac.
